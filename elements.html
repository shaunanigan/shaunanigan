									<h2>IT PROJECT IDEA</h2>
									<p><b>Ideas</b> are brave and sometimes they are just improvements.
									I've done my best to come up with something that I think is needed in the trade industry especially.
									It is something that will take time to learn the skills I need to create something like this, and especially where to
									begin with the right tools needed to make something. But I do think I can create it and its not to bad of an idea.</p>
									<ul class="actions">
										<li><a href="IT PROJECT IDEA1.pdf" class="button">IDEA!</a></li>

									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/animation.gif" alt="" /></span>So I dont have to much experience in using technology and tools to create an app or some kind of program as mentioned above. But I'm very eager to learn and hence why I'm doing my studies. I have found I have a real lack of experience throughout the field of IT but I do possess A lot of life experience.</p>
									<p>I think RMIT with its reputation is going to be the perfect place for me to learn everything I need to. So if I choose to go down another path for my career in IT I will have the freedom to be able to change knowing i'm learning skills from other parts of the industy. Weather it be cyber security, or programming, or even something like gaming or web design. I'm looking forward to the challenges that lie ahead</p>
