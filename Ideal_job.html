							<span class="image left"><img src="images/mario.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>My interest in IT started a long time ago, mostly when I was in high school, and I got into gaming and animation. Used a lot of Flash for animations and sketches plus I did a few high school IT subjects. But gaming took over for my choice and didnt do that great with school. Ended up doing a trade instead. Wouldnt change it, but more recently I have rediscovered my interest in all of IT and a change of career path is definitely something i'd like to achieve. Cant be on the tools forever</p>
							<p>As i've been helping out with my business advisers firm with some of their IT tools, like microsoft teams, and helping them through some of their issues i've discovered that there was something there. Something that I've really enjoyed doing and I can really make a long term career out of. Speaking to those guys as well I think my best interest would be in the cyber security division. Lots of money to be made in that specific department, however not the only reason to choose a career. Can work part time or freelance for a little more freedom to watch my kids grow up was a massive appeal to me</p>
							<p>RMIT ticked the boxes for me to study with. Can do a lot of online learning which was the only way I could make the timing work, plus they probably have the best reputation that I know of. I know that I'm going to not only learn the things I need to know to get involved into cyber security, but I'm going to understand a lot of other areas in case I change my mind and would like to try something else. I'm really looking forward to the challenge.

							This would be my Ideal job or something similar. Part time would be my prefrence, well to start with anyway. Hopefully one day I could go full time do a degree as long as I've got some flexibility. Its a challenging position so it's going to take a lot of extra study and hard work. But ideally I could either do that work in an office or from home, giving me the flexibility that I'd like. My current status in background experience would not even get me close to a job like this, so going through the RMIT courses is my only way to get to where I need to be.
